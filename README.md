## Automated Attendance Tracking

A Python program designed to help teachers streamline attendance.

This program scans a student's ID number and signs them into the classroom.
If an invalid number is scanned, the error will be recognized ad it will ask to input a valid ID number.
When a person is signed in, the time he is signed in will also be shown.
